However, the incremental design and high price mean it lacks the 'wow' factor of previous iPhones. Still, its power and intelligence are unrivaled.\n- CNET's review of the latest Samsung Galaxy: The Samsung Galaxy phone has plenty of high points, including an amazing screen, fast performance, solid battery life and an impressive array of camera options.

The new Galaxy is an amazing phone overall, but it has a few nagging weaknesses that keep it from achieving true greatness.\n- The Verge's review of the latest Google Pixel: Google's Pixel packs cutting-edge specs, innovative AI-powered software, and a killer camera into a sleek design. However, the phone has lackluster battery life, lacks expandable storage, and its performance stutters at times, especially considering its high price tag.
